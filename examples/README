This directory contains example programs which may also be used in testing a
new driver. If you are testing a new driver the trivial.{c,f} is of most
use, followed by views.{c,f}, and then poly.{c,f}. When those three work, try
the others. loc.{c,f} can be used for testing the mouse device if you have
one.

From the point of view of learning how to use VOGLE the suggested reading
order is below.
