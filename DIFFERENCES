VOGLE 1.1 has the following differences from 1.0:

Drivers:
	These have been extended to incorporate double
	buffering, the X11 driver should now work
	under anything (exception a dec workstation
	use decX11), the sun driver refreshes the window
	if it erased.

Library:
	Routines for doing backfacing, doublebuffering,
	positioning and sizing of windows (where it is allowed),
	getting info about the screen aspect ratio, specifying
	a world up vector, reading in a string of input have
	been added (it is best to look at the manual page for
	these).

Examples:
	There are some new examples demonstrating, position
	calls, backfacing, and doublebuffering.
