	Nature has a way, sometimes, of reminding man of just how
small he is. She occasionally throws up the terrible offsprings of
our pride and carelessness to remind us of how puny we really are
in the face of - a tornado, an earthquake or a Godzilla. The reckless
ambitions of man are often dwarfed by their dangerous consequences.
For now, Godzilla, that strangely - innocent and tragic monster, has
gone to earth. Whether he returns or not, or is never seen by human
eyes, the things he has taught us remain.
