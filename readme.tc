TurboC users should note that TurboC defines a "poly" routine in "math.h"
and that this sometimes conficts with our definition of "poly" in "vogle.h"

To Build everything using TurboC:

  	cd vogle\src
	make -fmakefile.tc
	cd ..\hershey\src
	make -fmakefile.tc
	mkfnts c:\lib\hershey		<== does a cd to vogle\examples
	make -fmakefile.tc
