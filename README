 ***  README -  Vogle *** 

 Vogle is an old public-domain graphics library. 

 From the old README -  

"VOGLE is a device portable graphics library that is loosely based on the
Silicon Graphics Iris GL. It was inspired partly by the DIGS library developed
at the U.S. Naval Academy under the guidance of Prof David Rogers, and in the
light of experience gained by some of the authors when working on the C-DIGS
project at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia, with Mike
Gigante." 

 I have also added the tarzipped files for VOPL.  From its README -  
"VOPL is a library of routines for doing fits and graph plots written using
the VOGLE graphics library." 

 As with D-Flat, the intention is to get Vogle updated so that it runs on Linux. 

 It is public domain so (as usual) - "share and enjoy....."  ;)
