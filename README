 ***  README -  Vogle *** 

 Vogle is an old public-domain graphics library. 

 From the old README -  

"VOGLE is a device portable graphics library that is loosely based on the
Silicon Graphics Iris GL. It was inspired partly by the DIGS library developed
at the U.S. Naval Academy under the guidance of Prof David Rogers, and in the
light of experience gained by some of the authors when working on the C-DIGS
project at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia, with Mike
Gigante." 

 As with D-Flat, the intention is to get this updated so that it runs on Linux. 

 It is public domain so (as usual) - "share and enjoy....."  ;)
